# TLDR
I created a python script to play clash royale for me. It starts the game, plays a game, collects the rewards, and repeats. It's a fun project to learn python and automation. 
source code is available at [github](https://github.com/Delioos/CRScript)

# Now the story - Clash Royale Farming Symphony: Unleashing the Infinite Elixir Fiesta

Prepare for a Clash Royale experience like never before with CRscript, a dynamic script designed to automate the strategic dance of cards and conquer the arena. Let's delve into the magic that powers this farming extravaganza!

## The Epic Quest

Embark on a journey to max out your card mastery, amassing gold and experience like a true Clash Royale maestro. CRscript is your companion in this quest, tirelessly engaging in an infinite loop of strategic battles, unleashing cards in a x3 elixir fiesta.

## The Technological Ensemble

Crafted with precision, CRscript comes to life through the enchantment of:

### Language
Python 3.9

#### Enchanting Libraries
- `time`
- `random`
- `pyautogui`

## Playing Clash Royale on the Big Screen

Navigate the Clash Royale arena seamlessly on your PC. Personally, I recommend the magic of BlueStacks 5, an Android emulator available at [bluestacks.com](https://www.bluestacks.com/).

## Setting the Stage

### Downloading the Script

Retrieve the magical script files through the various methods offered by our trusted friend, GitHub.

### Configuration Unveiled

_For now_, launch the script (`selfScriptFalsh.py`) in your terminal. Fear not, the script is a Python 3 masterpiece. Simply ensure you have Python 3 installed on your computer. A user-friendly build is in the works, bringing even more magic to your fingertips.

### On Windows

Summon the terminal by pressing the Windows key, type "cmd," and there it is — your command prompt awaits. Alternatively, right-click next to the file in the file explorer and choose "open the terminal here." Navigate to the script's lair (`cd c:user/game/crscript/`, for example), and beckon Python with the command `python`.

### On Linux

Invoke the terminal with the sacred shortcut (Ctrl + Alt + T), or use the terminal application. Alternatively, right-click beside the file in the file explorer and select "open the terminal here." Navigate to the script's sanctum (`cd /home/paulPao/Games/crscript/` if your games reside in your home directory), and let Python weave its magic.

## Beware: A Symphony for All Screens

Gone are the days of screen-specific scripts! CRscript now adapts to every realm. Embrace full-screen glory (press F11) to unveil the true magic. Behold, the spectacle:
