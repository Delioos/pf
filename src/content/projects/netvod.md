# TLDR 
Me and 3 of my classmate made a simple Netflix clone with basic features (accounts, email verifications, xss and sql injection protection ...) in a week for a school project.

# The official story  - NetVOD: Your Gateway to Cinematic Bliss

Welcome to NetVOD, where cinematic magic meets seamless functionality. Let me take you on a journey through the enticing realms of this Netflix-inspired clone, a creation brought to life using the dynamic trio of PHP, HTML, and CSS.

## The Project's Essence

At the heart of NetVOD lies the ambition to reimagine the streaming experience. It's not just about creating a platform; it's about crafting a virtual cinema where users can indulge in their favorite series, explore new releases, and build a personalized watchlist.

## The Technological Tapestry

Fueling this cinematic venture are the foundational pillars of PHP, HTML, and CSS. No fancy frameworks, just a pure blend of craftsmanship and code, ensuring a robust and straightforward architecture. Dive into the codebase, and you'll find the magic happening in the `src` folder.

## Unveiling Features

### Connecting the Dots in Your Database

Embark on the self-hosting journey by configuring your database through the `config.ini` file. Fill in the blanks with your preferred driver, host, database details, and watch your NetVOD world come to life. Tables like `EnCours`, `episode`, `notation`, `preferences`, `serie`, and `User` form the backbone, orchestrating a seamless symphony of data.

### Crafting Your Own Feature

Adding a new feature is akin to weaving a subplot into the narrative. Create an Action file in the `src/actions` folder, extending the class `Action` and breathing life into it with the `execute` method. Don't forget to update the `Dispatcher.php` switch case, maintaining the harmony within the code.
